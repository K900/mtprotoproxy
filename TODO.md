* commonize connection logic for direct/middle proxy
    * use auto v6 -> v4 -> die fallback everywhere
    * don't try v6 if it's not available
* figure out the promoted channel / proxy tag thing
* clean up middleproxy code
* think of a cleaner abstraction for basestreams
* expose a REST API for stats?
